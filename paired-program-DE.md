## 1. Goals
The goal of the project is mostly clear. But kind of vague at this point. It can help with studying many things, but what is the most simple outcome? Simulating many possible hybrid VCFs? If so, try
to emphasize that.

## 2. DATA
The input is two VCFs and a reference fasta. I think there should be an option for a second reference fasta, for hte case that the samples are very divergent and have different reference files. But that can be for more advanced implementation downstream.

### 3. CODE
The fetch fasta function seems to be working, and you have written nice skeletons for future functions. Good job.
